## Who’s this crab, Ferris?
Ferris is the unofficial mascot of the Rust Community. Many Rust programmers call themselves “Rustaceans,” a play on the word “crustacean.” We refer to Ferris with any pronouns “she,” “he,” “they,” “it,” etc.

Ferris is a name playing off of the adjective, “ferrous,” meaning of or pertaining to iron. Since Rust often forms on iron, it seemed like a fun origin for our mascot’s name!
